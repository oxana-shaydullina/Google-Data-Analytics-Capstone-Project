This analysis is the Case Study: 'How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?' from the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](http://grow.google/dataanalytics/), originally based on the case study ['Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization](https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study) by Kevin Hartman.

### Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The director of
marketing Lily Moreno believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your
team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes dierently. From these insights, your team
will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve
your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### Background
- In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.</br>
- Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One
approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
annual memberships. 
    - Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as <b>casual riders</b></br>
    - Customers who purchase annual memberships are <b>Cyclistic members</b></br>

## Business Task
<p>Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, <b>Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be
key to future growth</b>. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very
good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and
have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.</p>
<p><b>Moreno has set a clear goal</b>: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do
that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders dier, why casual
riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.</p>
<p><b>Three questions will guide the future marketing program</b>:</br>
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes dierently?</br>
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?</br>
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?</p>

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: <b>How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently</b>?

Answering the above question will help company understand the key differences in their customer behaviors and adapt a marketing strategy targetted towards casual members so that they can be converted into an annual members.

### Key Stakeholders
- <b>Cyclistic</b>: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself

work each day.
